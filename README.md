## 🛡️ Defensive Security Intro

**Room:** [Defensive Security Intro — TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/room/defensivesecurityintro)  
**Status:** ✅ Completed  
**Date:** *(29 March 2025)*

### 🎯 Objective
An introduction to defensive security and key areas such as Threat Intelligence, SOC, DFIR, Malware Analysis, and SIEM.

---

### 🗝️ Key Concepts
- **Defensive Security:** Focuses on preventing intrusions, detecting them when they happen, and responding properly.
- **Security Operations Center (SOC):** A team of professionals monitoring systems and networks for malicious activity.
- **Threat Intelligence:** Collecting and analysing data about threats to build a more informed defence strategy.
- **Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR):** Investigating attacks and responding to minimise damage and recover quickly.
- **Malware Analysis:** Studying malware like viruses and ransomware to understand how they work and how to defend against them.

---

### 🛠️ Tools Used
- **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management):** Used to detect suspicious activity and ban the IP.
- **Virtual Machine (VM):** Provided by TryHackMe to simulate a realistic SOC environment.

### ⚠️ Challenges Faced
- I struggled to understand what **policy violations** meant. After some research, this explanation helped it click:  
  *“Think of a security policy as a set of house rules — and when someone ignores or breaks those rules, it’s a violation.”*

---

### 🧠 What I Learned
- The importance of SOC teams in detecting threats and enforcing policies.
- Threat Intelligence helps prioritise what threats an organisation should defend against.
- Digital Forensics is about digging into cyber incidents like IP theft or espionage.
- Incident Response focuses on how quickly and effectively a team can react to attacks.
- Malware stands for *malicious software* — this made the concept more real to me.
- I was introduced to how SIEM tools help security teams spot and act on suspicious events.

### 🌐 Real-World Application
- **SIEM tools** help SOC analysts detect threats early by triggering alerts on suspicious activity like failed logins or unusual IP addresses.
- **Threat Intelligence** is used by companies to understand attacker behaviour and adjust defences to match.
- **Digital Forensics** tools help investigate cybercrime by examining logs, memory dumps, and systems to find how an attack happened.
- **Incident Response** is the structured process of reacting to cyber attacks, ensuring systems recover quickly and data is protected.
- **Malware Analysis** gives insight into how malware works, so defenders can block it and prevent future infections.

### 💭 Reflections
It was fascinating to see how a SOC works behind the scenes.  
The overlap between forensic science and **digital forensics** really stood out.  
Using SIEM tools felt like being a digital detective — hunting for suspicious activity and learning how to respond.  
Finally understanding what **malware** is and what **malware defenders** actually do made a big impact on me.
